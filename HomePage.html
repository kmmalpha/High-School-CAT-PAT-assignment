						<h2>Crowdfunding</h2>
						<p>In this phase of the PAT, my goal to research and find the necessary information to answer any questions posed in my previous two 
						phases. My other goal to better a number of the questions as they did not sufficiently contribute to the main question in the previous 
						phase. Along with finding the information to answer the posed questions, I will assess and determine the relevance of the information 
						found and whether it is suitable to use in my main report. The main target for this investigation is the Government Department, State 
						Security Agency, Environmental Health and Safety, who is responsible for the overall civilian intelligence operations.</p>
				<h3>What is Crowdfunding</h3>
					<p>It is the practice of funding a project by raising money from a large number of people, each contributing a relatively small amount, 
					typically via the internet.</p>
				<h3>How to optimise a crowdfunding campaign?</h3>
					<p>Crowdfunding is hard, and certainly a great deal requires luck, but there is a way behind most successful projects. Thereâ€™s a purely 
					empirical approach to show how to optimize your video, landing page, rewards, and the optimal length of time for your campaign.</p>
				<h3>What are the benefits of crowdfunding?</h3>
					<p>Crowdfunding can be used to great success to bring to life artistic projects, products for sale, and personal ventures like fixing up 
					a restaurant or helping a community in need.</p>
				<h3>Launch a website</h3>
					<p>Launching a website before starting your crowdfunding campaign is a good idea. Make sure you are already on different platforms of 
					social media, e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr etc.</p>
				<h3>Plan your campaign</h3>
					<p>A lot of things can go wrong. The most important include not locking down a manufacturing process, underestimating the difficulty 
					of scaling from a prototype, running out of money because of you've miscalculated the costs, and underestimating the success of a 
					campaign, which increases the level of complications.</p>
				<h3>Problems in Alexandra</h3>
					<p>Security is one of the biggest problems faced by the township. It has a high crime rate.</p>
				<hr /><h3>Main Question</h3>
					<p>In what ways can money be raised to ensure better security for the residents of Alexandra?</P><hr />
